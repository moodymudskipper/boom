# boom <img src='man/figures/logo.png' align="right" height="139" />

*{boom}* is a one function package that lets you inspect the results of the
intermediate results of a call. It "explodes" the call into its parts hence the name.
It is useful for debugging and teaching operation precedence.

Just provide any call to `boom()` or pipe to   `boom()` at the end of a 
*{magrittr}* pipe chain.

## Installation

Install with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("moodymudskipper/boom")
```

## Examples

```{r example}
library(boom)
boom(1 + !1 * 2)

boom(subset(head(mtcars, 2), qsec > 17))

library(magrittr)
mtcars %>%
  head(2) %>%
  subset(qsec > 17) %>%
  boom()
```

## Notes

*{boom}* prints intermediate steps as they are executed, and thus doesn't say anything about what isn't executed,
it is in constrast with functions like `lobstr::ast()` which return the parse tree. 

This will be noticable with some uses of non standard evaluation.

```{r}
lobstr::ast(deparse(quote(1+2+3+4)))

boom(deparse(quote(1+2+3+4)))

# standard evaluation
boom(1+2+3+4)
```
