# boom <img src='man/figures/logo.png' align="right" height="139" />

*{boom}* is a one function package that lets you inspect the results of the
intermediate results of a call. It "explodes" the call into its parts hence the name.
It is useful for debugging and teaching operation precedence.

## Installation

Install with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("moodymudskipper/boom")
```

## Examples

```{r}
library(boom)
boom(1 + !1 * 2)

boom(subset(head(mtcars, 2), qsec > 17))
```

You can use `boom()` with *{magrittr}* pipes, just  pipe to `boom()` at the end of a 
 pipe chain.

```{r}
library(magrittr)
mtcars %>%
  head(2) %>%
  subset(qsec > 17) %>%
  boom()
```

If a call fails, *{boom}* will print intermediate outputs up to the occurrence of the error,
it can help with debugging: 

```{r, error = TRUE}
"tomato" %>%
  substr(1, 3) %>%
  toupper() %>%
  sqrt() %>%
  boom()
```


## Addin

If you don't want to type `boom()` you can use the provided addin, named *"Explode a call"*,
just attribute a key combination to it (I use ctrl+shift+alt+B on windows), select the
call you'd like to explode and fire away!

## Notes

*{boom}* prints intermediate steps as they are executed, and thus doesn't say anything about what isn't executed,
it is in contrast with functions like `lobstr::ast()` which return the parse tree. 

This will be noticeable with some uses of non standard evaluation.

```{r}
lobstr::ast(deparse(quote(1+2+3+4)))

boom(deparse(quote(1+2+3+4)))

# standard evaluation
boom(1+2+3+4)
```
