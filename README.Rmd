# boom <img src='man/figures/logo.png' align="right" height="139" />

*{boom}* has been renamed to *{boomer}*, the name was conflicting with the CRAN
package *{Boom}*. Sorry for the oversight, and enjoy 
[*{boomer}*](https://github.com/moodymudskipper/boomer)!

*{boom}* won't be maintained and will be archived, possibly removed in the future.

Thanks @Data_question for suggesting the new name first.
