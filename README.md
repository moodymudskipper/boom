# boom <img src='man/figures/logo.png' align="right" height="139" />

*{boom}* has been renamed to *{boomer}*, the name was conflicting with
the CRAN package *{Boom}*. Sorry for the oversight, and enjoy
[*{boomer}*](https://github.com/moodymudskipper/boomer)\!

*{boom}* wonâ€™t be maintained and will be archived, possibly removed in
the future.

Thanks @Data\_question for suggesting the new name first.
